## What is Tim Video's?

Tim Video's is a collection of tools for live streaming conferences and user
groups. It includes both software and hardware for both the recording and
viewing sides.

It has been used with conferences like PyCon US and Linux.conf.au and at user
groups like Sydney Linux User Group and Sydney Python User Group.

# Important information

```config.private.json``` is referenced by many parts of the Tim Videos system.
It contains passwords, rooms/stream metadata, and other important information. 
Please ensure this is populated early (base it from ```config.json.example```.

# Parts

 * **website** - The actual website people end up seeing/going too. Uses
   jwplayer and django. The website is split into two parts;

    * The **frontend** is the UI which provides the tool and feel of the
      system. This system is stateless and requires no databases.

    * The **tracker** is the backend which keeps track of stats about the
      system. It is only accessed through a JSON API.

 * **tools** - Mish mash of parts of the streaming system.

    * **flumotion**, **flumotion-ugly** and **flumotion-fragmented-streaming**
      oftware which does the actual streaming.

    * **flumotion-config** - Example flumotion configuration files and some
      tools to push the configurations out to systems. Useful for conferences
      where you are managing a lot of encoders/collectors.

      There is a script in here called ```pusher/pushconfig.py``` which should be used
      to generate the correct Flumotion configuration files for encoders/collectors.      

    * **flumotion-extra** - Website controller of flumotion (replaces the GTK
      tool).

    * **portable** - Code to deal with the portable "in a box" solution.

    * **register** - Tool which reports an encoder (and how many clients are
      using the encoder - for load balancing) to tracker website.

    * **watchdog** - Tool which restarts bad flumotion components and systems.

    * **fluhelper** - Rewrite of the register and watchdog tools into one
      unified system.

    * **irclog2html** - Scripts for converting irclogs into the HTML format
      needed by the website.

    * **preview** - Scripts for capturing preview images from the video
      streams.

    * **setup** - Set up a server with the timvideo tools. 
      *Really needs to be replaced with proper configuration management such as puppet or chef.*

    * **youtube** - Upload recorded videos to YouTube channel.
